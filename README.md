# Avi(ral's) Graphics Library

Development of my own 3D rendering library to learn the most fundamental algorithms (along with their implementations) of Computer Graphics. 
It is written in purely in C.

Only two external libaries have been used <math.h> and <SDL.H>

Things I've *IMPLEMENTED* so far...

1. Vector Maths (Cross Product, Vector Product, Normalization etc.)
2. Prespective Divide
3. Frame Rate and Game Loop
4. BLA and DDA Line Algorithms
5. Scan Line Algorithm & Painters Algorithm
6. 3D Matrix Transformation (World Matrix, Perspective Projection Matrix, etc.)
7. Directional Lights and Flat Shading
8. Texture Mapping (PNG Textures) and Baycentric Coordinates
9. Perspective Correction
10. Camera View Frustum Clipping

## Motivation

Journey into becoming a graphics programmer / rendering engineer / game engine developer.
